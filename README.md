# selenium
This semester project was carried out as part of studying a software testing course. The main objective of the project was to explore the Selenium automation testing tool and its application in testing the guitar website called "Цз".

The aim of the project was not only to familiarize oneself with Selenium's functionality but also to apply the acquired knowledge in practice by writing 10 simple tests for the "Цз" guitar website. Each test represented a separate scenario, checking specific functionality or behavior of the web application.

During the project, testing scenarios were developed, serving as the foundation for writing automated tests. These scenarios described the sequence of actions to be tested and the expected results of each test.

The main stages of the project included studying the Selenium documentation, developing testing scenarios, implementing them using Selenium WebDriver, and running and debugging the tests.

As a result of the successfully completed project, skills in working with the Selenium automation testing tool were acquired, experience in writing automated tests for web applications was gained, and the ability to develop testing scenarios for verifying various functionalities of websites was improved.
